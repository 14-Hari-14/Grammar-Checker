# Spoken Grammar Assessment System

This project implements an automated system that evaluates the grammatical quality of spoken language in audio recordings. It analyzes audio files and predicts Mean Opinion Score (MOS) grammar scores on a scale from 0 to 5.

## Project Overview

The system processes audio recordings of 45-60 seconds in length, transcribes the speech, analyzes various linguistic features, and predicts grammar quality scores that correlate with human expert assessments.

### Dataset

- **Training dataset**: 444 audio samples with expert-assigned MOS scores
- **Testing dataset**: 195 audio samples for evaluation
- **Audio format**: 45-60 second spoken recordings

## Technical Approach

### 1. Audio Processing Pipeline

The system implements a multi-stage pipeline:

1. **Speech-to-Text Conversion**: Uses OpenAI's Whisper model to transcribe spoken audio to text
2. **Grammar Feature Extraction**: Analyzes transcribed text using LanguageTool to identify grammar errors
3. **Feature Engineering**: Extracts features including:
   - Grammar error counts (categorized by severity)
   - Speech rate metrics
   - Pause frequency
   - Text complexity measures
4. **Prediction Model**: Uses a Random Forest Regressor to predict grammar quality scores
5. **Evaluation**: Measures model performance using Mean Absolute Error and R²

### 2. Implementation Details

#### Key Components

- **GrammarChecker**: Core class handling transcription and grammar analysis
- **Training Pipeline**: Processes audio files in parallel with checkpointing
- **Prediction System**: Generates grammar scores for new audio files

#### Technologies Used

- **Speech Recognition**: OpenAI Whisper
- **Grammar Analysis**: LanguageTool Python
- **Audio Processing**: Librosa, PyDub
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn (RandomForestRegressor)
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Parallel Processing**: Python's concurrent.futures

## Results

The model achieved:

- Mean Absolute Error: [~0.5-0.7] on validation data
- R² Score: [~0.6-0.7] on validation data
- Distribution of predicted scores closely matched the training distribution

## Optimization Opportunities

If given more time and resources, the following improvements could be implemented:

### Feature Engineering

- **Prosodic Features**: Incorporate pitch, intonation, and rhythm analysis
- **Linguistic Complexity**: Include measures of syntactic complexity, lexical diversity
- **Speaker Characteristics**: Account for speaker-specific patterns and non-native speech patterns

### Model Improvements

- **Deep Learning Approach**: Implement end-to-end neural networks (CNN+RNN) to process audio directly
- **Transfer Learning**: Utilize pre-trained language models like BERT for more sophisticated linguistic analysis
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple predictive models for improved accuracy

### Performance Optimization

- **Distributed Processing**: Implement distributed computing for faster audio processing
- **GPU Acceleration**: Utilize GPU for speech recognition and deep learning components
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement more sophisticated caching to avoid redundant processing

### Evaluation Enhancements

- **Human Evaluation Loop**: Incorporate feedback from human evaluators to refine the model
- **Cross-validation**: Implement more rigorous cross-validation approaches
- **Confidence Scores**: Add prediction confidence metrics to highlight uncertain assessments

## Limitations and Considerations

- **Language Support**: Currently optimized for English speech only
- **Audio Quality**: Performance may degrade with poor audio quality or background noise
- **Computational Requirements**: Processing large audio datasets is resource-intensive
- **Expert Alignment**: Model predictions, while statistically sound, may not perfectly match human expert assessments

## Future Work

1. **Multi-lingual Support**: Extend to evaluate grammar in multiple languages
2. **Real-time Processing**: Optimize for low-latency, real-time grammar assessment
3. **Feedback System**: Provide specific grammar improvement suggestions
4. **Mobile Integration**: Develop lightweight version for mobile applications
